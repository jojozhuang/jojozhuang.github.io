## 1. Topological Sorting
Out-degree and In-degree

Given a digraph, put the vertices in order such that all its directed edges point from a vertex earlier in the order to a vertex later in the order (or report that doing so is not possible). Topological.java solves this problem using depth-first search. Remarkably, a reverse postorder in a DAG provides a topological order.

### 1.1 Problem Description
Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:
* For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
* The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.

Find any topological order for the given graph.

Example:
For graph as follow:
![image](/assets/images/dsa/1145/directed-graph.jpg){:width="300px"}

The topological order can be:
```sh
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
...
```

### 1.2 Solution
Calculate InDegree, use BFS approach.

```java
public class DirectedGraphNode {
    int label;
    List<DirectedGraphNode> neighbors;
    public DirectedGraphNode(int x) {
        label = x;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}

public class TopologicalSorting {
    /*
     * @param graph: A list of Directed graph node
     * @return: Any topological order for the given graph.
     */
    public List<DirectedGraphNode> topSort(List<DirectedGraphNode> graph) {
        if (graph == null || graph.size() == 0) {
            return null;
        }
        // calculate indegree
        Map<DirectedGraphNode, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (DirectedGraphNode node : graph) {
            for (DirectedGraphNode neighbor : node.neighbors) {
                map.put(neighbor, map.getOrDefault(neighbor, 0) + 1);
            }
        }

        List<DirectedGraphNode> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        // queue
        Queue<DirectedGraphNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (DirectedGraphNode node : graph) {
            if (!map.containsKey(node)) {
                queue.offer(node);
                ans.add(node);
            }
        }

        // bfs
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            DirectedGraphNode node = queue.poll();
            for (DirectedGraphNode neighbor : node.neighbors) {
                map.put(neighbor, map.get(neighbor) - 1);
                if (map.get(neighbor) == 0) {
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                    ans.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

## 2. Course Schedule
### 2.1 Problem Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`.

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:
```raw
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

Example 2:
```raw
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```
### 2.2 Solution
Topological Sorting, check if the number of visited course during BFS are same with the total number of courses.
```java
public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
    if (numCourses <= 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (prerequisites == null || prerequisites.length == 0) {
        return true;
    }

    Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();

    int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
    for (int[] pre : prerequisites) {
        indegree[pre[0]]++;
        if (!graph.containsKey(pre[1])) {
            graph.put(pre[1], new ArrayList<>());
        }
        graph.get(pre[1]).add(pre[0]);
    }

    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] == 0) {
            queue.offer(i);
        }
    }

    int count = 0;
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int course = queue.poll();
        count++;
        if (graph.containsKey(course)) {
            for (Integer nextCourse : graph.get(course)) {
                indegree[nextCourse]--;
                if (indegree[nextCourse] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(nextCourse);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return count == numCourses;
}
```

## 3. Alien Dictionary
### 3.1 Problem Description
There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are **sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.
* You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
* The dictionary is invalid, if a is prefix of b and b is appear before a.
* If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
* There may be multiple valid order of letters, return the smallest in normal lexicographical order

Examples:

Example 1:
```raw
Input：["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Output："wertf"
Explanation：
from "wrt"and"wrf" ,we can get 't'<'f'
from "wrt"and"er" ,we can get 'w'<'e'
from "er"and"ett" ,we can get 'r'<'t'
from "ett"and"rftt" ,we can get 'e'<'r'
So return "wertf"
```
Example 2:
```raw
Input：["z","x"]
Output："zx"
Explanation：
from "z" and "x"，we can get 'z' < 'x'
So return "zx"
```
### 3.2 Solution
Compare each word with its neighbor to calculate the indegree of each appeared character, then use topological sorting to find the letters in sequence.
```java
/**
 * @param words: a list of words
 * @return: a string which is correct order
 */
public String alienOrder(String[] words) {
    if (words == null || words.length == 0) {
        return "";
    }

    // initialize degree
    Map<Character, Integer> indegree = new HashMap<>();
    for (String word : words) {
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            indegree.put(c, 0);
        }
    }

    Map<Character, List<Character>> graph = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 1; i < words.length; i++) {
        String word1 = words[i - 1];
        String word2 = words[i];
        for (int j = 0; j < Math.min(word1.length(), word2.length()); j++) {
            char c1 = word1.charAt(j);
            char c2 = word2.charAt(j);
            if (c1 != c2) {
                if (!graph.containsKey(c1)) {
                    graph.put(c1, new ArrayList<>());
                }
                graph.get(c1).add(c2);
                indegree.put(c2, indegree.get(c2) + 1);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // use PriorityQueue instead of LinkedList for case "zy","zx" -> "yxz"
    Queue<Character> queue = new PriorityQueue<>();
    for (char c : indegree.keySet()) {
        if (indegree.get(c) == 0) {
            queue.offer(c);
        }
    }

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        char c = queue.poll();
        sb.append(c);
        if (graph.containsKey(c)) {
            for (char nextchar : graph.get(c)) {
                indegree.put(nextchar, indegree.get(nextchar) - 1);
                if (indegree.get(nextchar) == 0) {
                    queue.offer(nextchar);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return sb.length() == indegree.size() ? sb.toString() : "";
}
```
