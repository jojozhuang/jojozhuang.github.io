# Features

## Customizable theme
The theme can be customized just by changing few variables in **_config.yml** file.

## Inline CSS
Since the style used in this theme is very less, I'm inlining it. This will save a request and hence speeds up website loading.

## Light-weight
Since the theme is based on default Jekyll theme, it is very light-weight. No JavaScript except analytics is used!
