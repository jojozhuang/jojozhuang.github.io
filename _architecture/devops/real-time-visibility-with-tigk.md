> TIGK

## 1. What is TIGK?  
As you may know Stratus 1.0 went live recently. It is the next generation observability solution providing real time visibility into core-stack infrastructure and application health leveraging `TIGK` (Telegraf, InfluxDb, Grafana & Kapacitor) stack. It’s capabilities include:
* Enabling self-service model for visualizing metrics and configuring alerts
* Implementation of self-healing use case
* Implementation of autonomous alerts using prediction and anomaly detection
* Alert routing and critical monitoring data aggregation across datacenters.

In this session you will:
* Get an Overview of Project Stratus
* Learn about the technical architecture
* See a live Demo
* Q&A
